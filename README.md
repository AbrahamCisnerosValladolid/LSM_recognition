# LSM_recognition
## This work was develop for the "Escuela de oto√±o computacional CICESE (2023), in collaboration with Dr. Hussain Lopez and colleges. 

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques for detecting Localized Surface Modes (LSM) or similar physical phenomena. The 
notebook explores data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for LSM detection tasks.

## Features

* Data loading and visualization

* Feature engineering for LSM detection

* Machine learning model implementation

* Performance evaluation metrics

* Visualization of results

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

* Python 3.7+

* Jupyter Notebook/Lab

* NumPy

* Pandas

* Matplotlib/Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

## Notebook Structure

1. Data Loading: Import and examine the dataset

2. Exploratory Analysis: Visualize and understand the data

3. Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for modeling

4. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features for LSM detection

5. Model Training: Implement and train ML models

6. Evaluation: Assess model performance

7. Evaluation the model with real time photos.
